# inefficiency-detection-photovoltaic-solar-plants
Portfolio project: Discovery project for a renewable energy generation company. Found the source of existing efficiency problems in two photovoltaic solar plants by analysing data from sensors and meters (irradiation, temperature, inverter efficiency, powerâ€¦) in order to guide and optimize the efforts of the maintenance engineering team.
